Senior Project Repository

Here are the folders (main) located with subfolders or files that will be used in our game. 
We recommend following the name cases for some of these
folders as they are also used in our linking system to our game. If the folders are not named appropriately, then
the files may be "missing" or linked incorrectly when running in our game. 

This is for our First Person Adventure title "Mysteries in the Shadow" that is our senior project game.
