Update Notification
===================

I recently transferred these files from another Github account I made. The tag: Yoshicube64 was my previous Github account, which only holds my Senior Project. I use this account more, so I decided to for forth and transfer it to my main account ChrisC64.

Senior Project Repository

Here are the folders (main) located with subfolders or files that will be used in our game. 
We recommend following the name cases for some of these
folders as they are also used in our linking system to our game. If the folders are not named appropriately, then
the files may be "missing" or linked incorrectly when running in our game. 

This is for our First Person Adventure title "Mysteries in the Shadow" that is our senior project game.
